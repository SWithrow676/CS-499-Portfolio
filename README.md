# CS-499 Portfolio

Hello, my name is Stewart Withrow, and I have been in the Computer Science degree program since August of 2021. I originally started studying at Nashua Community College (NCC) for an Associate's Degree in Computer Science. Then I moved on to Southern New Hampshire University to earn a Bachelor's Degree in the same field. This page serves as my ePortfolio, showcasing the skills I have acquired over the past four years in completing my assignments. This ePortfolio contains a professional self-assessment, a code review, and three code enhancement artifacts that demonstrate my skills in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and databases.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Since I began my journey into Computer Science in September 2021, I have progressed from a basic understanding of coding to gaining confidence and a wealth of knowledge that will enable me to excel in the field. I have developed skills in designing, developing, and improving software by applying programming principles in the real world.  Compiling this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase the skills I have learned and reflect on my growth, which defines me as a developer. Being able to go back and enhance my previous work has been key in strengthening my understanding of problem-solving, data-driven development, and secure software development, which are essential in the modern technology industry.

### Professional Growth and Program Impact
The coursework throughout my college career has provided me with a range of Computer Science-based skills and disciplines, such as software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and database development. Every project I’ve worked on presented challenges, requiring my problem-solving skills, discipline, and critical thinking to complete projects. While working on these projects, I had to adapt to situations to deliver not just a project that meets the conditions but also one that utilizes scalability, maintainability, and security. These elements are key to providing a top-of-the-line project that aligns with professional development. Working on this portfolio has allowed me to refine these skills, improve existing code, and implement ideas of professional development while showcasing my ability to adapt to technologically complex environments.

My experience has shaped my values and goals in professional development, emphasizing clean, modular, and secure code while also considering collaboration to bring a project to life. I work to ensure that each task is balanced between a technical and a collaborative approach, ensuring that the code meets both the needs of the user and the goals of the business. This mindset has allowed me to grow as a new developer and improve my skills as a team member, making me a well-rounded contributor to any software team.

### Collaboration and Communication
Throughout the degree, I have had to challenge these collaboration and communication skills in team environments through various team projects. One that stands out was the class project for a Systems Analysis and Design course, where, through taking the lead in developing a theoretical application, I learned the value of approaching the group using clear and respectful communication. While communicating with my team and presenting the plan to a group, I have learned to convey both technical and non-technical information to a diverse audience, including those who are technologically knowledgeable and those who are not. An example of these skills is when I had to explain the many features of an Android application I developed and lay out a launch plan for stakeholders who may not be as knowledgeable about the technical aspects of my project. This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in presenting my work and plans to a diverse audience while maintaining their integrity.

### Technical Proficiency: Software Engineering, Algorithms, and Security
My coursework has allowed me to apply and polish my skills in algorithmic principles, software engineering methodologies, data structures, and security. I used algorithms to improve a program’s performance, scalability, and reliability. For example, in the algorithm artifact, I replaced ``ArrayLists`` with ``HashMaps``, utilized input validation and blocklists to prevent malicious data (which can also fall under security), continued using negative testing in test functions, and maintained a steady coverage score with JUnit to ensure no ends are left loose. Implementing these aspects throughout my artifact demonstrated my growth in algorithmic efficiency and sound software design. In the database artifact, I implemented pagination and database indexing to optimize the load of a large dataset and its queries, improving execution time and responsiveness, especially for lower-end systems. Skills in software, algorithms, and databases come with essential security skills for managing all the artifacts. Implementing aspects of a program, such as input validation, blocklists, injection prevention, and proper exception handling, can prevent injections, data corruption, misuse, and error exploitation. Working through the coursework and this capstone project has consolidated my skills and emphasized that they are not an afterthought but are integral to the Software Development Life Cycle.

Integration of Artifacts and Professional Competence
The three artifacts in my ePortfolio showcase the skills I have acquired within the field of Computer Science. From software engineering to secure coding practices, these artifacts act as the culmination of learning throughout the past four years.
- **Artifact One** contains a 3D environment for a Computer Graphics project using OpenGL and C++. The artifact focuses on modularity, class refactoring, optimization, and user interaction.
- **Artifact Two** includes a Java environment with classes for mobile application functionality and corresponding test classes to assess the code’s functionality and coverage using JUnit. The artifact focuses on algorithmic refinement, input validation, and test-driven development.
- **Artifact Three** contains a Python client-server dashboard application that displays entries in a database and allows the user to interact with the data using filters and search queries. The artifact focuses on database implementation, user-interface refinement, and the secure handling of CRUD methods. 

### Conclusion
My academic experience and the development of this ePortfolio have allowed me to consolidate my years of learning into a project that represents my work. Putting this all together has effectively prepared me to contribute as a software developer in a proper development environment. By implementing algorithmic efficiency, secure coding practices, and collaborative communication, I am confident that I can produce professional, modular, and scalable software projects in any development environment.

## Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

The artifact I worked on to improve for the first enhancement was my project for CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization, which I created during the Spring 2025 semester. The artifact is a C++ program with OpenGL/GLUT API for rendering and visualization. The program creates a 3D, interactable environment where users can navigate using key inputs, interact with light sources, import 3D models, and control camera movement.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it not only demonstrates my software engineering skills but also showcases my skills and knowledge in object-oriented programming and graphics programming. With C++ being one of my more experienced programming languages, I wanted to leverage that familiarity to take a project that was already passable and make it better and more user-friendly. I also wanted to demonstrate my Object-Oriented Programming skills by using modularization to move some key functionality into its own header and implementation files, thereby giving the code a more manageable and organized state. Refactoring that code into their own class files relates to both object-oriented programming skills and software engineering skills. Some other enhancements I made were to align the scene colors more closely with an actual building scene, including a wood-brown floor, drywall walls, and a ceiling. I also added gravity to keep the camera aligned with the floor, as well as boundaries to prevent the user from leaving the environment's boundaries. Other minor enhancements were made, including adjustments to smaller mechanics like strafing, a jump button, window optimization, and comment improvements, to further strengthen the project. Here is the list of enhancements:
- Refactored logic tied to the ``Door`` and ``Camera`` to their own encapsulated classes.
- Reduced some magic numbers to use variables or constants instead.
- Optimized the window sizing to be 80% of the screen size and maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- Enhanced the overall organization and documentation of the code to keep the code maintainable and in line with modern coding standards.
- Implemented wall collision to prevent clipping and a gravity/jump mechanism.
- Added some extra visual details, such as a doorknob and a window cutout.
- Encapsulated variables from the global state to reduce reliance on global nonconstant variables.
- Removed redundant logic, such as repeated code in separate functions, where possible.

The artifact can also contribute to other course outcomes, such as delivering professional-quality written communication with enhanced comments. However, the result I outlined was achieved because the development utilized innovative techniques with the “Camera” and “Door” classes, applying software engineering design principles to enhance the code's modularity. I was able to follow my plan laid out in Module One to the best of my ability, with one exception. I decided to omit the limitation on the camera’s turning, as it restricted the exploration of the environment. With time as a limitation and my focus on exploration freedom within the confines of the environment, I decided to leave this idea out, as it defeated the purpose of exploration freedom.

Upon reflection on enhancing the artifact, I gained a lot from this experience. I gained practical experience in refactoring code from a single file into an object-oriented structure. I was also able to learn more about effectively using constants, modularity, and encapsulation to make code reusable and maintainable, as well as the importance of an aspect ratio in graphics-based applications. Some challenges I faced during this enhancement were determining the best location for constant variables (global vs. class) to maintain consistency.  Ensuring that gravity, jumping, and collision worked smoothly was also a challenge, as implementing gravity proved difficult, and then making sure it worked well with the new environment mechanics was also a challenge. As a result of overcoming these challenges, a more modular and organized artifact was created from a previous version, demonstrating graphical rendering and professional software engineering practices.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact I chose to work on and improve for the second enhancement was my main project for the class CS-320: Software Test and Automation, taken during the Spring 2025 semester. The artifact is a Java project that contains project files for the functions of an application, including storing appointment, contact, and task information. There are also corresponding test classes that test the functions of the project classes and ensure all requirements are met. The coverage of each test and function is verified using ``JUnit``, which also helps automate testing to ensure that all aspects are covered and to identify any errors that need to be addressed.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my skills in algorithms, data structures, and software testing practices within the context of a Java application basis. The enhancement allowed me to show my ability to build and refine an application that can retrieve and store different types of data while remaining maintainable. I am presenting my skills in enhancing an existing codebase by adding new functionality, reducing redundancy, strengthening data security, and optimizing the algorithmic aspects of the application. Some algorithmic improvements include using HashMaps instead of ArrayLists to reduce complexity, utilizing input validation with a blacklist of forbidden words to design a pre-processing algorithm that only reads and stores valid data, and maximizing test coverage by adding edge cases and employing negative testing. Some other changes I made to this artifact were expanding the exception handling to provide more detail per exception thrown, expanding the ``AppointmentService`` to add a function to edit an entry, and making the code comments more straightforward by utilizing ``JavaDocs``. These changes enabled me to enhance the application’s maintainability, usability, and security, while demonstrating my skills in algorithmic and software engineering.	
Here is the list of enhancements:
- Refactored data structure usage for consistency and efficiency, which uses HashMaps instead of an ArrayList.
- Reduced some magic numbers and strings to use variables instead.
- Added additional functionality to ``AppointmentService`` to include editing entries.
- Added input validation to prevent malicious data inputs for attacks.
- Coverage was maintained to stay above 90% overall, with expansion of existing refactor tests and negative testing to cover all edges and functionality.
- Enhanced error handling to add a more descriptive error message.
- Enhanced documentation by using ``JavaDocs`` and reducing redundant comments.

The course outcome this artifact is intended to support is designing and evaluating solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. Through the enhancement of this artifact, I demonstrated the ability to apply necessary data structures for effective lookups using ``HashMaps``, implement stronger input validation to ensure smooth execution, and balance improvements while considering trade-offs in favor of more substantial enhancements. The other outcome this can align with is a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs, exposing potential vulnerabilities and utilizing strong input validation to prevent possible misuse. While I had planned to maximize coverage to around 100% or more, I decided to prioritize other aspects of the application, such as validation, error handling, and maintainability. This decision reflects the necessity of making trade-offs where needed to focus on more important aspects of an application, such as security, validation, and expanding on the existing refactor tests and negative tests.

Upon reflecting on this artifact enhancement, I learned how important small changes in structure and validation can be and the significant difference they make. By refining the data structure, I enhanced application performance, expanded testing areas across all project files and services, and prevented malicious data from being processed, which could cause a database injection. I also worked on coverage, maintaining a similar scale to the old version, around 90%, while recognizing that coverage is not as important as implementing proper security features. The negative testing skips an invalid test, which lowers the coverage, even if this is intended. Some challenges I faced were maintaining consistency across the different parts of the application, as it initially had an inconsistent structure and validation. Another challenge was to maximize coverage, as I lost some when adding functionality. To address this, I had to ensure that the new additions were effectively tested to ensure they were covered. Overcoming these challenges enabled me to demonstrate a better understanding of the skills required for testing, validation, algorithms, and data structures that mirror real-world development scenarios.

## Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact I chose to work on and improve for the third enhancement was the second project for the class CS-340: Client and Server Development, which I completed during the Spring 2025 semester. The artifact is a Python project that contains a ``.py`` file, which houses the CRUD functions of the code. These functions consist of creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in a database. The second file contains the code to run a dashboard web application that displays a database to the user. It includes filtering options, query searching and sorting, a map based on each entry’s latitude and longitude coordinates, and a pie chart to show the ratio of breeds in the database. These files are currently designed to retrieve entries from the database and display them to the user, ensuring they work together seamlessly. The CRUD file provides the dashboard functionality, and the dashboard utilizes the CRUD file.	

This artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio because it directly ties to an existing database, allowing me to demonstrate my skills with a NoSQL MongoDB database. The enhancement showed my ability to optimize data storage and queries, improve CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operators, and implement defensive programming to ensure database security and efficiency. Some of the improvements made included strengthening the CRUD functions by validating data before insertion, updating, or deleting entries based on entry ID, and implementing indexing for easier retrieval. More robust error handling was also implemented to provide feedback for empty queries and failures in the CRUD functions, facilitating more straightforward diagnosis of the issue. In the code overall, there was a general overhaul of organization to enhance comments with docstrings, maintain consistent style and spacing according to modern Python standards, and establish consistent naming conventions. Inconsistencies in naming and spacing could hinder readability. Furthermore, the arguably most important one is the dashboard, which is now fixed. It includes more user-friendly filter dropdowns, a decluttered pie chart, feedback when no data is found, and the correction of any existing errors in the chart or map. These changes enhanced the overall structure of the code and the dashboard, while also improving the code's interaction with the database to provide increased security during updates and data retrieval.
Here is the list of enhancements:
- Refactored both files to reduce redundancy, spacing issues, and inconsistent naming, as well as improved documentation.
- Improved error handling with more detailed exception messages and defensive validation.
- Enhanced CRUD methods by updating/deleting by ID.
- Implemented input validation to prevent injections and other malicious data from being inserted into the database.
- Implemented indexing on important fields, ``animal_id``, ``breed``, ``type``, and ``location``, to improve query performance.
- Optimized the dataset load by using pagination, which loads a portion of the database while also providing an option to list a certain number of entries or all.
- Enabled “case insensitive” toggle by default for query searching.
- Fixed web-application UI elements, including the map marker functionality, pie chart clutter, and feedback for no results.
- Worked to add compatibility for running on a Windows device versus Linux.

This enhancement encompasses not only one of the course outcomes but also two, as it considers both design principles and security principles. As outlined in the original planner, this enhancement demonstrates the ability to use well-founded techniques that meet industry-standard goals, such as optimizing CRUD methods with effective error handling. This enhancement also yields another outcome: developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits. An example of this is data and input validation, which can prevent possible injection or malicious activity if the user is given input prompts that could be exploited using the database. As for the enhancement plan, the plan was met with inclusions like setting less restrictive search queries as default (use case insensitive “contains” searches), migrating the code from a Linux Ubuntu environment to a Windows environment, adding query optimization using pagination, adding indexing for frequently searched fields, and implementing more user-friendly and descriptive error handling. Although it wasn't in my planner, I wish I had implemented the rest of the CRUD functionality if I had time, as the code originally only used the read function to pull and display the data. The setup is in place, with functions improved according to the enhancement plan, facilitating a smoother implementation if time permits. Despite this trade-off, the project focuses on the more essential aspects such as application usability, database efficiency, and database security.

Reflecting on the enhancement process of this artifact, I learned the importance of data integrity and validation when working with live databases. Implementing improvements such as data schema enforcement, error handling, and indexing is crucial for both performance and user experience. I also gained more experience with client-server interactions, such as filtering, queries, and UI work, which helps keep the user experience consistent and pleasant. Some challenges I faced were implementing queries, as a simple implementation would force the application to limit the number of entries accessible through it. Using the idea of a “filter,” as with the pre-existing one, can solve the problem and also change the number of entries being loaded, optimizing the query and allowing for a more controlled user experience. This allowed me to focus more on optimizing the dataset and web application to create a more efficient and flexible solution with a larger dataset. The enhancement improved not only the technical aspects of the application but also the database operations and the secure handling of data.
