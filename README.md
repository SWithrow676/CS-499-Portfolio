# CS-499 Portfolio

Hello, my name is Stewart Withrow, and I have been in the Computer Science degree program since August of 2021. I originally started studying at Nashua Community College (NCC) for an Associate's Degree in Computer Science. Then I moved on to Southern New Hampshire University to earn a Bachelor's Degree in the same field. This page serves as my ePortfolio, showcasing the skills I have acquired over the past four years in completing my assignments. This ePortfolio contains a professional self-assessment, a code review, and three code enhancement artifacts that demonstrate my skills in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and databases.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Since I began my journey into Computer Science in September 2021, I have progressed from a basic understanding of coding to gaining confidence and a wealth of knowledge that will enable me to excel in the field. I have developed skills in designing, developing, and improving software by applying programming principles in the real world.  Compiling this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase the skills I have learned and reflect on my growth, which defines me as a developer. Being able to go back and enhance my previous work has been key in strengthening my understanding of problem-solving, data-driven development, and secure software development, which are essential in the modern technology industry.

### Professional Growth and Program Impact
The coursework throughout my college career has provided me with a range of Computer Science-based skills and disciplines, such as software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and database development. Every project I’ve worked on presented challenges, requiring my problem-solving skills, discipline, and critical thinking to complete the project. While working on these projects, I had to adapt to situations to deliver not just a project that meets the conditions but also one that utilizes scalability, maintainability, and security. These elements are key to providing a top-of-the-line project that aligns with professional development. Working on this portfolio has allowed me to refine these skills, improve existing code, and implement ideas of professional development while showcasing my ability to adapt to technologically complex environments.
My experience has shaped my values and goals in professional development, emphasizing clean, modular, and secure code while also considering collaboration to bring a project to life. I work to ensure that each task is balanced between a technical and a collaborative approach, ensuring that the code meets both the needs of the user and the goals of the business. This mindset has allowed me to grow as a new developer and improve my skills as a team member, making me a well-rounded contributor to any software team.

### Collaboration and Communication
Throughout the degree, I have had to challenge these collaboration and communication skills in team environments through various team projects. One that stands out was the class project for a Systems Analysis and Design course, where, through taking the lead in developing a theoretical application, I learned the value of approaching the group using clear and respectful communication. While communicating with my team and presenting the plan to a group, I have learned to convey both technical and non-technical information to a diverse audience, including those who are technologically knowledgeable and those who are not. An example of these skills is when I had to explain the many features of an Android application I developed and lay out a launch plan for stakeholders who may not be as knowledgeable about the technical aspects of my project. This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in presenting my work and plans to a diverse audience while maintaining their integrity.

### Technical Proficiency: Software Engineering, Algorithms, and Security
My coursework has allowed me to apply and polish my skills in algorithmic principles, software engineering methodologies, data structures, and security. I used algorithms to improve a program’s performance, scalability, and reliability. For example, in the algorithm artifact, I replaced ``ArrayLists`` with ``HashMaps``, utilized input validation and blocklists to prevent malicious data (which can also fall under security), continued using negative testing in test functions, and maintained a steady coverage score with JUnit to ensure no ends are left loose. Implementing these aspects throughout my artifact demonstrated my growth in algorithmic efficiency and sound software design. In the database artifact, I implemented pagination and database indexing to optimize the load of a large dataset and its queries, improving execution time and responsiveness, especially for lower-end systems. Skills in software, algorithms, and databases come with essential security skills for managing all the artifacts. Implementing aspects of a program, such as input validation, blocklists, injection prevention, and proper exception handling, can prevent injections, data corruption, misuse, and error exploitation. Working through the coursework and this capstone project has consolidated my skills and emphasized that they are not an afterthought but are integral to the Software Development Life Cycle.

Integration of Artifacts and Professional Competence
The three artifacts in my ePortfolio showcase the skills I have acquired within the field of Computer Science. From software engineering to secure coding practices, these artifacts act as the culmination of learning throughout the past four years.
- **Artifact One** contains a 3D environment for a Computer Graphics project using OpenGL and C++. The artifact focuses on modularity, class refactoring, optimization, and user interaction.
- **Artifact Two** includes a Java environment with classes for mobile application functionality and corresponding test classes to assess the code’s functionality and coverage using JUnit. The artifact focuses on algorithmic refinement, input validation, and test-driven development.
- **Artifact Three** contains a Python client-server dashboard application that displays entries in a database and allows the user to interact with the data using filters and search queries. The artifact focuses on database implementation, user-interface refinement, and the secure handling of CRUD methods. 

### Conclusion
My academic experience and the development of this ePortfolio have allowed me to consolidate my years of learning into a project that represents my work. Putting this all together has effectively prepared me to contribute as a software developer in a proper development environment. By implementing algorithmic efficiency, secure coding practices, and collaborative communication, I am confident that I can produce professional, modular, and scalable software projects in any development environment.
